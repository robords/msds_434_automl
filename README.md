# Robords MSDS 434 AutoML/Autopilot

## About
* Notebook for AutoML on GCLoud using BigQuery (msds_434_automl.ipynb)
* Notebooks for Sagemaker Autopilot on AWS:
  * Tutorial_Autopilot.ipynb (works)
  * weather_predictions_autopilot.ipynb (work in progress)

## Next steps
Definitely some flaws with the weather prediction model to look into:
* Figuring out a way to balance the data a bit better would be ideal
 * This will involve getting more data from more years, not just 2022, at least
* Figure out how to build the weather classification model on Sagemaker
